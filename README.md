Two separate problems to solve:

1. Get data into client in a form usable by visualizations

2. Pattern for multiple D3 visualizations that enables link-and-brush



SVG PROFILE VISUALIZATIONS

- Load up SVG file separately from a "profile" version.

- Individual elements of file 


Register visualization.

- Text + image.  Use a SVG profile to identify where the text elements should go.
  Animate the elements when the move to new positions.

"Day" visualization.

- Text only.  Show all data for a particular day.
  Includes data not actually on the register page.
